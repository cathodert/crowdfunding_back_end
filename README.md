# Crowdfunding Back End
Catherine Blentweyne

## Planning:
### bandtogethr
bandtogthr is a platform to raise funds to get international metal bands to come to include Perth on their tour downunder.

### Intended Audience/User Stories
This site is for metalheads sick of missing out on the best bands, or having to fork out thousands of dollars to travel interstate (or overseas) to see the acts they love.
Individuals can launch a campaign to fund a band or artist, or pledge to an existing campaign. 
All campaigns should have in-principle agreement of the band or artist to include Perth in their tour (subject to funding) prior to pledges being opened.
The site is not intended for high-profile, mainstream musicians that perform in stadiums or similar. Rather it is intended to support artists or bands playing to audiences at the smaller live music venues around the city.
